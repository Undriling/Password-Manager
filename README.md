$ Key Features of the Password Manager:----
->Encryption with Fernet:- All passwords are encrypted using Fernet, which employs AES encryption with HMAC authentication, ensuring that only the correct key can decrypt the stored data.

->Secure Storage:- Encrypted passwords are stored in a .txt file . The encrypted data is base64 encoded, making it safe for storage and transmission.

->Key Management:- The application uses a secret key generated by Fernet, which is crucial for both encryption and decryption. This key must be stored securely, which is in .key format.

->Easy Retrieval and Decryption:- The password manager allows users to view their saved credentials by decrypting the data with the stored key, making it convenient to access passwords when needed.

->User Authentication:- Optionally, we can implement user authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access the stored credentials. In my code my authorized Username is "Manash01" and Password is "Undriling01".
